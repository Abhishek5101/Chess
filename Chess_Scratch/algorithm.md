# **Piece Class**

## What should it do?

The piece class will be the abstract class for all of the piece classes and should store color, 
position, and piece name. It should also have methods that set and return the position, color, 
as well as methods that determine the slope of the line between the next and current position 
and methods that determine whether or not the piece is still within the boundries of the board

# **Actual piece classes**

Add move checking methods for each class that determine whether or not the passed in position
is a valid move and add appropriate attributes that aren't in the abstract Piece Class 

# **Project Plan**

## Overall Goals

1. Make a board that has pieces that can make basic movements
2. Impliment more chess rules to how move behavior works
3. Get working player classes that can play against eacher
4. Add more advanced features such as complex chess moves, 
move counters, and turn timers

## Coding Goals

1. Make comments that explain the code when reasonable amount of progress has been made
2. Try to work on project at least once a day
3. Try to have working chess prototype working within a month
